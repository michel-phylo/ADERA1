Tensorflow workflow for a smart QUESTION ANSWER search engine 
We used a questionâ€“answer pipeline consisting of two phases. The first phase aims to text mine relevant publications to extract compounds that could activate Nrf2. The sentence embedding was calculated for each publication using a DAN auto encode, together with the imposed question. All putative answers were ranked using an optimized sorter function, and the highest answer presented. The second phase aimed at filtering the answers according to their relevance using a DCN neural network.
compele explnation on how to use this network is detailed in the wiki page.
